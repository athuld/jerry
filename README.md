# Jerry
The core idea of the script is that it allows users to watch anime in sync with their anilist account, automatically updating and tracking all progress (down to seconds of an episode watched).

But the script also has a lot of other features, which you can find in the features section.

<summary>Windows installation instructions</summary>

* This guide covers how to install and use jerry with the Windows Terminal (which comes pre-installed with Windows 11), you could also use a different terminal emulator, that supports fzf, like for example Wezterm
* Note that the Git Bash terminal does *not* have proper 
fzf support

Basically, what we are going to do is install the bash shell and use it to install the shell script. We will also install the mpv video player and fzf, which are required for the script to work.

1. Install scoop

Open a PowerShell terminal https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.2#msi (version 5.1 or later) and run:

```ps
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
```

2. Install git,mpv and fzf

```ps
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install git extras/mpv fzf
```
3. Install windows terminal (you don't need to have a microsoft account for that)
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install

4. Install git bash (select the option to add it to the windows terminal during installation)
   https://git-scm.com/download/win

(The next steps are to be done in the windows terminal, in a bash shell)

5. Download the script file to the current directory
```sh
curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justchokingaround/jerry/main/jerry.sh"
```

6. Give it executable permissions
```sh
chmod +x jerry.sh
```

7. Copy the script to path
```sh
cp jerry.sh /usr/bin/jerry
```

8. Use jerry
```sh
jerry --help
```
